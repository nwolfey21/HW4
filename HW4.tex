\section{Data Source (ROSS)}
%Description of the data source and corresponding applications.

\section{Research Questions}
%Write down at least 2 specific research questions that can be solved by analyzing this data. The first should be "obvious" and may simply communicate the overall quantity of data you've got your hands on. The second should be more complex or subtle, that can be answered by the data, but will involve rearranging or simplifying or finding correlations within the data.

\section{Hypotheses}
%What are your specific hypotheses related to these research questions? What knowledge are your drawing on to make these predictions?

\section{Data Format}
%With your research questions in mind, design the detailed format for your raw data (the columns of your data "spreadsheet") and decide on the action or sampling frequency for each "row" of the data. Make sure you are able to acquire an "interesting" amount of data, both number of samples (at least 1000 rows?) and dimensions per sample (at least 3 columns?) Note: These estimates are not requirements. If your data has many more columns, things can be quite interesting even with far fewer rows.

\section{Data Extraction \& Manipulation}
%Detail the efforts you made to collect, parse, reorganize, simplify, and/or post-process this data source.

\section{Sample Visualizations}
%Create (at least 2) simple visualization plots of this data using a tool that's new to you (or you would like to learn more about). Consider using: Excel, LineUp, Tableau, Google Analytics, Plotly, or VTK. These plots should attempt to answer the research questions you posed earlier. You can revise your research questions as needed as you work with the data.

\section{Visualization Tool Review}
%A brief review of the tool you used to create the visualizations.
